# fast_particle_collision_time
Calculates slowing down and deflection times for a test alpha particle interacting with Maxwellian background ions, electrons, and thermonuclear alpha distributions. Includes estimation of the thermonuclear alpha distribution function.

# Assumptions

- Maxwellian background
- Deuterium density equals tritium density
- Electron temperature equals ion temperature
